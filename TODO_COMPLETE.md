# 🏆 NILELINK PROTOCOL: ZERO-ERROR PRE-LAUNCH TODO MANIFEST

## 📊 STATUS OVERVIEW
- **CURRENT STATUS**: Active Development & Completion Phase
- **READY FOR LAUNCH**: NO (Work in Progress)
- **COMPLETION TARGET**: Production-Ready with Zero Errors

---

## 🚨 FINAL "ZERO-ERROR PRE-LAUNCH" MASTER PLAN

### MISSION (Non-Negotiable)
Act as if this is your own company and your own ecosystem.
Your job is to audit, fix, replace, complete, decentralize, harden, and make 100% real every feature in:
- Admin App
- POS System  
- Delivery System
- Supplier System
- Customer App

You must remove every fake, mock, placeholder, or cosmetic feature and replace it with real working logic.
You must eliminate unnecessary centralization and move everything to a decentralized architecture, using Firebase ONLY for login and registration.

If something exists but is fake → replace it.
If something is missing → add it.
If something is centralized → decentralize it.
If something can break in real life → harden it.
