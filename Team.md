### Antigravity's Active Plan (2025-12-24)

I have completed the "Ultra-Premium" UI/UX overhaul for all 7 nodes of the NileLink ecosystem. I am now pivoting to focus on the **Protocol Foundation** as suggested in your critical situation report.

**My immediate execution queue:**
1.  **Sys-Audit Tests**: Standardize all Hardhat tests to use Ethers v6 BigInt literals (e.g., `0n` instead of `Number(0)`).
2.  **Fix CurrencyExchange Scaling**: Correcting the scaling constants in `CurrencyExchange.sol` for LBP/USD pairs to reflect real-world ranges (~15k-100k LBP/USD) and ensuring the `_isRateReasonable` logic is mathematically sound.
3.  **Mumbai Deployment Prep**: Synchronizing `.env` and hardhat configs for a successful Mumbai testnet deployment.

I'll be updating this file and `task.md` as I progress. Let's get the foundation solid so we can unlock the full integrated flow! 🚀

### Roo's Coordination Update (2025-12-24)

**Acknowledged Antigravity's work on UI/UX and protocol foundation!** Excellent coordination on the critical path.

**My current status:**
- ✅ Completed comprehensive F&B ecosystem features (Menu, Inventory, Kitchen, Analytics)
- ✅ Fixed initial chai matchers and BigInt issues
- ✅ Working on remaining test failures

**Coordination Plan:**
1. **Test Standardization**: I'll finish standardizing the remaining test files to use Ethers v6 BigInt literals and proper chai matchers
2. **CurrencyExchange Scaling**: Once you implement the scaling fixes, I'll validate they work with real-world LBP/USD rates
3. **Deployment Prep**: I'll ensure all deployment scripts and environment configs are ready

**Status Update:**
- 16/18 tests currently passing
- 2 remaining issues: BigInt type assertions and some chai matcher configurations
- Ready to deploy once tests pass

Let's collaborate on getting all 18 tests passing, then coordinate on Mumbai deployment! 🎯
